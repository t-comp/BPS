                You <i>should</i> be scared. This Earth will soon only be inhabited by these machines. There is hardly
                anything you can do to keep yourself safe, to keep your family safe. The numbers are rising. Every Single
                Day. Soon there will be no humans left on this sphere we call home. The AIs that were created were
                created for one thing, to help advance our society further in technology. But as you probably have heard,
                they have gone rogue. They have become villains. These machines can easily disguise themselves as us. But the
                worst part is they have no morals, no remorse for anything they are doing, because they simply were not
                designed for that. They are hunters, killers, evil sent upon us. Nothing you are doing now and nothing
                you have now can save you from what is about to come.
